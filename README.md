I have been back and forth kind of between two projects working on this Phase 1. I submitted the second one as more things worked, but not fully how I wanted them too. 
This Phase was designed to make a functioning Library Management System in which we can display the contents of the file the user has seelcted, print the database to the screen, remove books from the file by either their title or barcode/isbn/id number, add books to the collection, and check books in or out by their title. 
Each method works, it just doesn't necessarily update in the text file, while my other version of this project, not all the methods worked, but everything would update in the text file.
